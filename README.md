# regal-test-assessment

This is the implementation of Test Scenario #1.

A simple weather app using [AccuWeather API](https://developer.accuweather.com/), [Bootstrap v4.0.0](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/), [jQuery v3.6.0](https://jquery.com/), and [jQuery AJAX](https://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/) with autocomplete location search and 3 day forecast in selected location.

Steps to use this application:
1. You will need to sign up for a free account in [AccuWeather API](https://developer.accuweather.com/) to get your own API key.
2. Replace the [forecast.key](https://github.com/johnlibron/regal-test-assessment/blob/main/js/forecast.js#L15) with your new API key.
3. You can run the application on your desktop browser by clicking the [index.html file](https://github.com/johnlibron/regal-test-assessment/blob/main/index.html).
4. Always to replace the [forecast.key](https://github.com/johnlibron/regal-test-assessment/blob/main/js/forecast.js#L15) to a new API key because AccuWeather puts a limit on queries on a free account. Delete your app in the [AccuWeather website](https://developer.accuweather.com/) and create a new one to get a new API key.
